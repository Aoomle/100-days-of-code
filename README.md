## 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 28 January, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Iâ€™ve signed up @Rwenderlich -> https://www.raywenderlich.com/ios/paths/learn to learn iOS and Swift. 
Getting started with SwiftUI.
Learned SwiftUI Views and Modifiers.
Learned the basics of OOP Objects, Data and Methods.

**Thoughts:**  Started with a challenge, make a programming to-do list of all the things I will need to do to build the game. This concept introduced me to what algorithm is. 

**Link to work:** [Bulleye App v0.1.0](https://github.com/Aoomle/Day1GettingStartedWithSwiftUI)
